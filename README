HolidayPlanner:
HolidayPlanner is an AI-powered travel planning system that generates customized holiday itineraries based on user preferences like destination, budget, and duration. It ensures fair recommendations, diverse destinations, and provides visual flow diagrams of the agentic workflow.

Features:
Custom Itineraries: Generates travel plans based on user input.
Destination Diversity: Avoids recommending the same popular destinations repeatedly.
Budget Fairness: Supports budget ranges from economy to luxury.
Metrics Tracking: Logs execution results for each agent.
Flow Visualization: Generates a visual graph of the planner workflow.
Flexible Execution: Run via CLI or deploy with Streamlit UI.

Execution logs are available in the logs/ folder.

Notes:
Ensure that all required Python packages (e.g., networkx, matplotlib) are installed.

Unicode symbols (✅, ❌) in flow diagrams may not render in all environments—Dockerized fonts generally handle them correctly.
